            The combined experience I have working at the top of Fortune 500
            companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that helps me in not
            just development, but in every aspect of any business.

          <p className="description">
            I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
            largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself
            as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.

            As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
            holding you back is yourself.

            "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've
            already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time
            to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're
            passionate about.
